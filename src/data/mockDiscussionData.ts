First, create an adjacency list representation of the graph, then run DFS from each unvisited node, incrementing a counter for each new connected component discovered. The time complexity is O(V+E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.',

The approach is very similar - you still need to count the number of times you initiate a traversal from an unvisited node.
